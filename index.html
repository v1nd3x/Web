	<h1>Sub Domain Takeover</h1>
	<p>This is a sample web page that demonstrates a sub domain takeover vulnerability. In this scenario, the sub domain "sub.example.com" is being used by an external service, but the service has been discontinued and the domain owner has not updated their DNS records to reflect this change. This leaves the sub domain open for takeover by an attacker.</p>
	<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could set up a new service on their own server and point the sub domain to their server using a DNS record. This would allow the attacker to have full control over the sub domain and use it for malicious purposes, such as phishing attacks or hosting malicious content.</p>
	<p>To prevent sub domain takeovers, it is important to regularly check and update DNS records to ensure that all sub domains are being used as intended. It is also important to monitor sub domains for unusual activity and take immediate action if any is detected.</p>
